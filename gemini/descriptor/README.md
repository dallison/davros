# Important note about Descriptor and Field messages
The `Descriptor` and `Field` messages are used by the generator but the generator
is needed to build the generated versions of the message.  This is a circular
dependency and the way I have broken that is to copy generated versions of the
messages into this directory.

The files `Descriptor.cc`, `Descriptor.h`, `Field.cc` and `Field.h` were generated by
Davros and then copied into this directory.  This eliminates the dependency on the
`gemini_serdes_library` used to generate them from the generator itself.

If the `Descriptor` or `Field` messages are updated, these files will need to be
rewritten by newly generated versions.

This can be done by running the `gemini` command manually.
